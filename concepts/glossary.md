**BLAST by Bware Labs** - A decentralized node infrastructure offering fast and reliable blockchain APIs in collaboration with node providers. BLAST enables developers to build scalable and seamless decentralized applications (dApps) across multiple blockchain networks.

**Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)** - A property of distributed systems that allows them to reach consensus even in the presence of malicious or faulty nodes. CrossFi Chain employs BFT mechanisms to ensure transaction reliability and network integrity despite potential node failures.

**Consensus** - The process by which blockchain network participants agree on the ledgerâ€™s state, verifying transaction validity. CrossFi utilizes **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)** for efficient and scalable consensus, ensuring fast transaction processing on **CrossFi Chain**.

**Convertation** - The process of exchanging one type of asset or token for another within a blockchain ecosystem. In CrossFi, users can convert **XFI to MPX** or vice versa through supported platforms and bridges, facilitating asset management and network participation.

**Cosmos** - A decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains, each using BFT consensus algorithms. CrossFi Chain is built on Cosmos technology, enabling **interoperability and cross-chain communication** via the **Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)**, expanding ecosystem connectivity.

**Cosmos SDK** - An open-source framework designed to simplify the creation of customizable blockchains based on the **Tendermint** consensus algorithm. It provides developers with pre-built modules and tools, allowing them to focus on application logic rather than network and consensus mechanisms. Using the **Cosmos SDK**, CrossFi Chain achieves high performance, security, and scalability while offering developers a flexible platform for building decentralized applications.

**Cross-Chain** - The ability of blockchain networks to **interact and transfer data or assets between one another**. CrossFi specializes in **cross-chain solutions**, allowing seamless movement and interaction of tokens such as XFI across different blockchains.

**Cross-Chain Bridge** - A technology that connects two different blockchain networks, enabling **asset and data transfers** between them.

**CrossFi App** - A **Web3 bank** within the CrossFi ecosystem. It provides users with a **convenient and secure** way to manage their financial operations. Through the **CrossFi App**, users can spend XFI directly from their wallets, integrating traditional banking services with the benefits of blockchain technology.

**CrossFi Chain** - The core **blockchain network** within the CrossFi ecosystem, built on **Cosmos technology**.

**CrossFi Foundation** - The governing body responsible for the **development and strategic direction** of the CrossFi ecosystem. It manages initiatives such as **staking rewards, grants, and partnerships** to promote sustainable growth and community-driven innovation.

**CrossFi xApp** - A **suite of decentralized applications** within the CrossFi ecosystem, offering users various **DeFi tools**, including **token swaps, liquidity provision, staking, and asset management**.

**Crypto** - Short for **cryptocurrency**, referring to **digital or virtual currencies** that use cryptographic techniques.

**Crypto Exchanges** - Platforms where users can **buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies**. CrossFi supports **integration with both centralized and decentralized exchanges**.

**Covalent** - A platform that extracts blockchain data through **APIs**, allowing users to access **transaction history, network activity, and wallet data**. This integration enables **developers and CrossFi users** to analyze key data for informed decision-making and ecosystem optimization.

**dApp** - A **decentralized application** that runs on a blockchain network instead of a centralized server. CrossFi supports **dApp development and integration**.

**DIA** - In the CrossFi context, **DIA serves as an oracle platform**, providing **customizable on-chain and off-chain data** to enhance the accuracy and reliability of **smart contracts**. This integration supports applications requiring **transparent and verifiable information**.

**Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)** - A consensus mechanism where **token holders delegate their governance tokens** to a smaller group of validators who secure the network, distributing rewards in return. CrossFi Chain employs **DPoS** for efficient and scalable consensus.

**Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** - The runtime environment for **smart contracts** on Ethereum. CrossFi supports **EVM-compatible chains**, allowing developers to deploy and interact with **Ethereum-based dApps** within the CrossFi ecosystem.

**Ethereum** - A leading **blockchain platform** known for its **smart contract capabilities** and decentralized applications. CrossFi integrates with Ethereum through **EVM compatibility and cross-chain bridges**.

**Governance** - The process by which **network decisions are made**. In CrossFi, **MPX holders** participate in governance by voting on proposals related to **ecosystem upgrades, protocol changes, and strategic initiatives**, ensuring **decentralized and community-driven management**.

**Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)** - A protocol that enables **secure and permissionless cross-chain communication** between blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem.

**Liquidity Pools** - A reserve of tokens **locked in smart contracts** to facilitate **trading and liquidity provision**.

**Liquid Staking** - A staking method that allows users to **earn rewards while maintaining liquidity** through **derivative tokens**. In CrossFi, users can stake **XFI or MPX** and receive **LP tokens (e.g., lpXFI or lpMPX)** that can be used in **DeFi activities** to maximize yield.

**LP Tokens** - Tokens representing a user's **share in a liquidity pool**. In CrossFi, tokens like **lpXFI and lpMPX** are issued to users providing liquidity to pools such as **eMPX/XUSD**. These tokens enable users to **earn trading fees, participate in staking, and access governance rights**.

**MPX (Mint Power)** - The **governance and staking token** of the CrossFi ecosystem. It secures the network through staking, enables **governance participation**, and facilitates the minting of XFI. MPX plays a **central role in maintaining network stability and decentralized decision-making**.

**POKT** - A **decentralized infrastructure** that provides **API access to blockchain data**.

**Proof of Stake (PoS)** - A consensus mechanism where **validators are chosen based on their token holdings** and the amount they are willing to stake as collateral. CrossFi Chain uses **PoS**, specifically **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**.

**RPC (Remote Procedure Call)** - A protocol allowing applications to request services from programs on other computers in a network. CrossFi utilizes **RPC endpoints** to facilitate **dApp interaction and data exchange** with CrossFi Chain.

**Solidity** - A **smart contract programming language** used on Ethereum. CrossFi supports **Solidity-based contracts**, enabling developers to deploy smart contracts within the CrossFi ecosystem, leveraging **cross-chain and DeFi capabilities**.
