# FAQ

**1. Why does CrossFi Chain use two tokens?**

CrossFi Chain utilizes **MPX** and **XFI** to optimize network functionality. **MPX** operates within the **Cosmos-based** segment for **staking, transaction fees, and network governance participation**. **XFI** is used in the **EVM-based** segment for **transaction fees, smart contract interactions, and decentralized applications (dApps).**

**2. What is a Layer 1 blockchain?**

A **Layer 1 blockchain** is a **base network** that handles **security, consensus, and transaction processing** without relying on additional layers or external solutions. **CrossFi Chain is a Layer 1 blockchain**, providing its own **independent infrastructure**.

**3. What is an EVM blockchain?**

An **EVM blockchain** is a network compatible with the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**, enabling the execution of smart contracts written in **Solidity** or **Vyper**. EVM compatibility facilitates **seamless migration and development** of dApps between networks. The **EVM layer in CrossFi Chain** allows developers to deploy smart contracts, expanding the ecosystem’s capabilities.

**4. What is the role of a cross-chain bridge in a blockchain ecosystem?**

A **cross-chain bridge** enables **interoperability between different blockchains**, allowing users to **transfer tokens and data** across networks. In CrossFi Chain, the bridge facilitates **XFI transfers** between **CrossFi Chain, Ethereum, BSC, Base, and Arbitrum**.

**5. What are blockchain layers?**

Blockchain architecture is divided into different layers:

* **Layer 1** – The base layer responsible for **core operations and network security**.
* **Layer 2** – Secondary protocols built on top of Layer 1 to **enhance scalability and transaction speed**.

This division **improves performance** while maintaining **decentralization and security**.

**6. How does the staking mechanism work in CrossFi Chain?**

Users can **delegate MPX tokens** to validators, who help **secure the network** and maintain **consensus**. In return, delegators receive a **portion of validator rewards**, proportional to their stake. Staking incentivizes network participation while providing **passive income opportunities**.

**7. What are MPX and XFI, and how are they used?**

* **MPX** – The primary token in the **Cosmos-based** part of CrossFi Chain, used for **staking, transaction fees, and governance**.
* **XFI** – The token used in the **EVM-based** part for **transaction fees, smart contract interactions, and dApp participation**.

Both tokens play an essential role in **CrossFi Chain’s functionality and growth**.

**8. How can I acquire XFI and MPX tokens?**

* **XFI** is available on **decentralized exchanges** like **Uniswap v2** and **SushiSwap**, as well as **centralized exchanges** such as **MEXC, HTX, and Gate.io**.
* **MPX** can be acquired via **GetMPX**, where users can exchange **USDT** for **MPX**.

**9. What is CrossFi Bridge, and how do I use it?**

**CrossFi Bridge** is a **cross-chain transfer tool** that allows users to **move XFI** between CrossFi Chain and networks like **Ethereum, BSC, Base, and Arbitrum**. Users can **send XFI** to external addresses or **transfer tokens back** to their CrossFi Chain wallet, increasing its usability across multiple chains.

**10. How can developers interact with CrossFi Chain?**

Developers can build **smart contracts** and **dApps** using the tools and **SDKs provided by CrossFi Chain**. With **EVM compatibility** and **integration with Ethermint and Evmos**, the development and migration of applications are seamless. **CrossFi Foundation** also offers **grants and technical support**.

**11. What is the role of CrossFi Foundation in the ecosystem?**

**CrossFi Foundation** is a **non-profit organization** that fosters ecosystem growth by funding projects, organizing hackathons, and running educational programs. It **provides grants** to developers and startups, driving innovation and expanding the functionality of CrossFi Chain.

**12. How can I ensure the security of my funds in CrossFi’s ecosystem?**

To **enhance security**, users can leverage **xSafe (Multisignature, EVM)**, which enables **multi-signature wallets** requiring approval from multiple addresses. Additionally, it is crucial to use **trusted wallets** and follow security best practices when interacting with dApps.

**13. How can I participate in network governance in CrossFi Chain?**

Governance participation requires **MPX tokens**. Users can **create and vote on proposals** that influence the development and functionality of the network. This **decentralized governance model** empowers the community to shape the future of CrossFi Chain.

**14. What is Escrow XFI, and how does it work?**

**Escrow XFI** allows users to **vest their esXFI rewards** and convert them into **fully tradable XFI**. Users initiate the vesting process, wait for the designated period, and then claim their **converted XFI** to their wallet.
