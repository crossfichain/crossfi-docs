# Roles

The CrossFi ecosystem brings together a wide range of participants, each playing a unique role and contributing to the advancement of decentralized financial technologies. Below are the key roles within the ecosystem.

### **Users**

Users are the foundation of the CrossFi ecosystem. They interact with ecosystem applications for asset storage, exchange, and management.

Users seek convenient and secure ways to manage their assets. They utilize CrossFi applications to generate passive income through staking or participation in liquidity pools. Transparent operations, automatic reinvestment of earnings, and asset protection ensure a smooth user experience. The ability to earn compound interest makes the ecosystem attractive for long-term investors.

Additionally, users value the integration of traditional financial services with decentralized solutions, such as non-custodial crypto cards and fast payment protocols. This allows them to seamlessly transition between fiat and crypto ecosystems while maintaining full control over their funds.

### **Liquidity Providers**

Liquidity providers contribute their assets to liquidity pools through xSwap. Their role is to maintain adequate liquidity levels for decentralized financial instruments.

Liquidity providers are motivated by transaction fees and rewards for supplying liquidity. Participation in liquidity pools not only generates passive income but also supports ecosystem growth. High liquidity enhances the platform’s attractiveness to new users and investors.

Furthermore, liquidity providers can leverage cross-staking mechanisms and cross-chain bridges to optimize their returns and minimize risks.

### **Validators**

Validators ensure the security and stability of the CrossFi Chain network. They participate in the consensus process, validate blocks, and receive XFI rewards for their work. Validators self-delegate MPX and attract delegators to increase their stake.

Their primary motivation is earning rewards for maintaining the network. Additionally, they strive to be reliable ecosystem participants, fostering trust among delegators. A higher stake increases their chances of being selected to generate new blocks, leading to additional income.

### **Delegators**

Delegators are users who delegate their MPX to validators to increase their stake. Delegators receive a share of the validator’s rewards, making their participation profitable.

Delegators seek passive income without requiring technical expertise. The CrossFi system minimizes risks for delegators through automatic restaking and compensation mechanisms in case of slashing. This creates a secure investment environment, allowing users to focus on earning rewards.

***

### **Developers**

Developers build smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) using ecosystem tools such as Ethermint, Evmos, and Cosmos SDK.

They are motivated by the opportunity to create innovative solutions that expand CrossFi’s functionality. Participation in the **CrossFi Foundation’s grant programs** and community support allows them to secure financial assistance for developing new projects. The creation of valuable tools and applications strengthens the ecosystem and enhances its appeal to users.

***

### **Governance Participants**

Governance participants make strategic decisions about the ecosystem’s development. They use MPX to create and vote on proposals that shape the network’s future.

They aim to influence the ecosystem’s direction and define long-term goals. Active participation in governance allows them to receive additional rewards and be part of the decision-making process, fostering a sense of involvement in the platform’s success.

***

### **Escrow Participants**

Escrow participants convert their esXFI into XFI, receiving additional rewards for their long-term commitment to the ecosystem. This role supports sustainable growth in CrossFi by incentivizing active participation.

They seek to maximize returns on their investments. Additional rewards for holding esXFI over the long term encourage ecosystem stability, helping to maintain a balanced token economy.

***

### **Investors**

Investors provide liquidity to the network and support its growth by acquiring MPX, supplying liquidity, and employing long-term investment strategies.

They aim to profit from the appreciation of ecosystem assets such as XFI, MPX, and XUSD. Their participation strengthens CrossFi’s financial foundation and fosters the development of decentralized financial instruments.
