# Vision and Mission

CrossFi and CrossFi Chain aim to break down the barriers that limit access to financial services for more than [**60% of the world's population**](https://gfmag.com/data/worlds-most-unbanked-countries/). \
We envision a world where everyone, regardless of location or economic status, has the ability to control and manage their finances through **reliable, secure, and accessible** tools.

## **Our Mission**

The CrossFi ecosystem was created to eliminate inefficiencies in both traditional and decentralized finance. To achieve this, we developed an **innovative gateway** powered by **WEB3 technologies** and our **Layer 1 blockchain—CrossFi Chain**. This powerful combination merges the reliability of traditional financial tools with the flexibility and transparency of decentralized systems.

Our goal is to **combine the best of traditional finance with blockchain innovations**. CrossFi provides a solution that **eliminates the boundaries between fiat and digital currencies**, granting users **freedom and control over their assets**.

We are building an ecosystem that enables **everyone—from users to developers—to take part in shaping the future of fintech**.

We are driving revolutionary changes in **financial services and blockchain technology**. Our goals are clear:

* Provide access to **instant and independent financial services** for everyone.
