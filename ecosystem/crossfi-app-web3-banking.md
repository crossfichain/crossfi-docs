<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

CrossFi App is an innovative Web3 banking application designed to revolutionize the financial sector. Built on the CrossFi Chain blockchain, it seamlessly integrates decentralized finance (DeFi) with traditional banking services. The app enables users to conveniently and profitably use cryptocurrency as fiat in everyday transactions while ensuring secure and flexible asset management through an intuitive interface.

***

## Why Choose CrossFi App?

CrossFi App stands out with its unique combination of features, making financial management convenient, secure, and accessible:

* **Crypto-Fiat Integration**: Thanks to a unique gateway, CrossFi App allows users to use cryptocurrency like regular money—no extra steps or complex exchange processes required. All necessary conversions happen automatically "under the hood" in fractions of a second, enabling instant purchases and transfers.
* **Control and Sovereignty**: Unlike traditional banks that can manage your funds independently, CrossFi App employs a non-custodial approach. Private keys for connected wallets, along with full control over your funds, remain solely with you. At any time, you—and only you—can quickly and securely deposit or withdraw funds from the app.
* **Global Accessibility**: The app operates in over 90 countries, and the CrossFi Card is accepted at 100 million points worldwide.
* **Security**: Leveraging the CrossFi Chain and its architectural features, the app ensures complete security and transparency. All operations with connected wallets are processed through verified smart contracts, and any transaction can be traced using its hash. As security is a critical aspect, we’ll discuss it in more detail below.

## How It Works

### About CrossFi App

The cornerstone of CrossFi App is the CrossFi Card. Unlike traditional bank cards, the CrossFi Card is directly linked to your crypto assets. It looks and functions like a standard Visa card, ensuring full compatibility with the existing global payment infrastructure.

* **Virtual Card**: Instantly created, providing quick access to online purchases, contactless payments, and transfers to other CrossFi App users.
* **Physical Card**: In addition to the virtual version, you can order a physical card, which can be used like any other physical card, such as at ATMs. Note: A virtual card cannot later be converted into a physical one, so choose the physical option at the outset if needed.
