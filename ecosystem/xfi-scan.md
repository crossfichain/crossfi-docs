# XFI Scan

{% embed url="https://xfiscan.com/dashboard" %}

XFI Scan is a highly functional blockchain explorer for the CrossFi Chain network, providing transparent and real-time access to all blockchain activity data. The platform is designed to offer developers, investors, and end-users the ability to monitor network dynamics in detail, verify transactions, analyze validator performance, manage assets, and interact with other ecosystem modules.

### **Main Page**

The XFI Scan main page aggregates key statistical indicators of CrossFi Chain's operation, allowing users to gain a general understanding of the network's performance and stability. It displays the current XFI token price, market capitalization, and MPX-related data, including the annual percentage return (APR). Additionally, this page provides information on blocks, including the total number of blocks created, the average block formation time (approximately 5 seconds), and a summary of transaction statistics, such as the total number of transactions and the network's transaction throughput (TPS).\
In the **Emission** section, users can review XFI issuance periods, the number of tokens issued per block, and other emission parameters, allowing for an assessment of token distribution dynamics throughout the network's lifecycle.

### **Validators Section**

[Validators ](../node-operators/becoming-a-validator/)are key participants responsible for ensuring the security, stability, and operation of the CrossFi Chain network. They verify transactions, create new blocks, and maintain consensus, which forms the foundation of the decentralized system. The network currently allows a maximum of 64 active validators (expected to increase to 128), achieving an optimal balance between decentralization and system efficiency.

XFI Scan enables users to track validator activity within the network. The **Validators** section provides detailed data on each validator, including uptime metrics, the number of missed confirmations, and the volume of delegated MPX tokens.\
This information helps assess the reliability and performance of validators, which is crucial when selecting partners for delegating tokens. The system incentivizes validators through commissions, rewards, and bonuses for active participation, motivating them to adhere to high operational standards and ensuring transparent network management.

### **Tokens Section**

This section provides users with comprehensive information about the[ tokens](../economy-overview/) circulating within the CrossFi Chain network, enabling liquidity monitoring and token movement analysis.\
Here, users can track statistics for native tokens ([XFI ](../economy-overview/xfi-coin.md)and [MPX](../economy-overview/mpx-coin/)) and third-party tokens issued on the blockchain. Available data includes the number of tokens in circulation, the number of holders, total issuance volume, and transaction history. Each token has a unique address that allows users to access detailed information, including transaction counts and user distribution.

### **Blocks & Transactions Sections**

XFI Scan provides in-depth information on each block, including the block number, timestamp, size, transaction count, gas usage, base fee, and the list of validators involved in block creation.\
Transaction details include unique hashes, timestamps, sender and recipient information, transaction type, involved assets, and fees paid. These metrics allow users to conduct a deep analysis of network operations and assess validation quality.

### **NFTs Section**

The **NFTs** section of XFI Scan aggregates data on non-fungible tokens, enabling users to explore NFT collections, track transfers, and analyze holder statistics. The information includes the total number of NFTs in collections, transaction history, smart contract addresses, and other indicators, providing insights into digital collections' activity and value.

### **Governance Section**

The **Governance** section allows users to monitor and analyze proposals, voting processes, and decentralized governance outcomes via XFI Console. This section displays information on each proposal, including its type (e.g., software upgrades, treasury fund allocation, or text initiatives), status (approved or rejected), and voting statistics.\
This transparency ensures that the community can actively participate in shaping the ecosystemâ€™s future.\
For more details on **Governance (DAO) mechanisms**, please refer to the corresponding documentation page.

### **Address Conversion Tool**

XFI Scan features an address converter that quickly transforms addresses between Cosmos and EVM formats. Users can input an address in one format and obtain its converted version, streamlining interactions with various applications and facilitating data integration across CrossFi systems.

### **XFI Scan API**

XFI Scan provides developers with an **API interface** for real-time access to blockchain data. This API allows users to retrieve information on blocks, transactions, validators, smart contracts, NFTs, and other network parameters. The API integrates with external analytical tools and platforms, making XFI Scan an essential resource for building custom solutions and network monitoring.
