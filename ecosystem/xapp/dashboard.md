# Dashboard

The **Dashboard** is the central monitoring panel in xAPP that displays up-to-date information about your assets and actions. Right after connecting your wallet, you land on the Dashboard for a quick overview of your portfolio. The interface is clean and clear, showing your balances and recent actions to help you track your investment status in real time.

On the **Dashboard**, you can quickly check:

* **Token balances** in your wallet — e.g., XFI, XUSD, USDT, and other supported cryptocurrencies. You immediately see how much CrossFi native assets and stablecoins you hold.
* **LP token balance** — your share in liquidity pools (if you’ve already provided liquidity). Each LP token type (lpXFI, lpUSD, etc.) is shown with the amount you own.
* **Transaction history** — a list of your recent actions within xAPP: swaps, liquidity deposits/withdrawals, staking, rewards claims, etc. Each record includes operation type, date, and status — helpful for tracking your activity and confirmations.

The Dashboard keeps all your CrossFi activity under control. From here, you can navigate to other sections (Swap, LP Tokens, Staking, Rewards) to initiate new actions.

**Tip:** Check your Dashboard regularly to monitor your investment growth.
