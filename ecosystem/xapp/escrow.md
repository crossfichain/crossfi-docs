# Escrow

The **Escrow** section in xAPP is where you manage the **vesting** of your **escrowed XFI (esXFI)**. Vesting is the process of gradually unlocking your esXFI tokens, converting them into fully liquid XFI and depositing them into your wallet. This allows you to increase your overall yield without withdrawing your LP stake.

## What Is Vesting?

* **esXFI** — “escrowed” XFI earned as staking rewards.
* **Vesting** — locking up a portion of your esXFI in the vesting contract so it can mature (linearly over the vesting period) into spendable XFI.
* **Note:** Once you begin vesting a given amount of esXFI, that portion will **no longer generate** further staking rewards.

## How to Vest esXFI

1. **Go to Escrow → Vesting**
2. **Enter amount of esXFI to vest** (you can click **Max** to vest your full esXFI balance)
3. **Confirm** the transaction in your wallet
4. Your selected esXFI is now locked in vesting, and you’ll start unlocking XFI over time

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Vesting esXFI stops that portion from earning additional esXFI or BP.

## How to Claim XFI

1. **Switch to “Claim XFI”** in the Escrow tab
2. **Review** your **Unlocked XFI** balance (the amount fully vested to date)
3. **Click Claim** and confirm the transaction
4. The unlocked XFI is sent to your wallet as free, spendable XFI

## Mini‑FAQ

**Can I vest only part of my esXFI?**\
Yes—you choose any amount up to your current esXFI balance. Remaining esXFI continues earning rewards until vested.

**What happens if I unstake LP while vesting?**\
Unstaking LP does **not** cancel existing vesting. However, vesting new esXFI will slow or stop until you restake LP.

**Is there a minimum vesting period?**\
Yes—each vesting tranche follows the protocol’s linear schedule (e.g. 6 months). The exact period is shown in your vesting status.

## Summary

* **Escrow** is where you manage conversion of esXFI → XFI via **vesting**.
* **Vesting** locks your esXFI and stops it earning more rewards.
* **Claim XFI** lets you withdraw unlocked XFI at any time.
* **Vesting status** displays how much is locked, unlocked, and the time remaining.

Use Escrow to turn your locked rewards into spendable XFI on your own schedule, while still keeping your LP stake active and earning new rewards.
