# xApp

**CrossFi xAPP** is a decentralized application (DApp) in the CrossFi ecosystem, combining core DeFi features on a single, convenient platform. Users can swap tokens, provide liquidity to pools and receive LP tokens, stake them, and earn rewards — all through an intuitive interface.

### **Advantages**

CrossFi xAPP acts as an _omni-DeFi_ platform, bundling all essential tools for managing crypto assets. This all-in-one approach saves time and eliminates the need to switch between different applications. The high-speed transaction engine of CrossFi Chain ensures near-instant execution, which is especially useful for arbitrage and fast portfolio rebalancing.

### **Security**

User and fund security is a top priority for CrossFi xAPP. The app doesn’t require a separate account: **authentication is handled via your own wallet** (by signing transactions), so your private keys always remain with you. All transmitted data is encrypted using modern protocols (SSL/TLS), securing your browser's connection to the service.

### **Wallet Support:**

To use xAPP, you need an EVM-compatible wallet. The application is natively compatible with MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and others via WalletConnect.

Connecting a wallet unlocks access to all xAPP features and ensures secure transaction execution on behalf of the user. Future updates will expand wallet support, so users can choose their preferred storage for digital assets.

### **Main Navigation:**

The xAPP interface is divided into several core sections, accessible via the sidebar:

* [**Dashboard**](dashboard.md)**:** The main page showing balances of your tokens and LP tokens, along with your transaction history.
* [**Swap**](swap.md)**:** A built-in decentralized exchange for token swaps.
* [**LP Tokens**](lp-tokens.md)**:** A section for adding liquidity to pools and receiving LP tokens.
* [**Staking**](staking.md)**:** A page to stake LP tokens and earn rewards.
* [**Rewards**](rewards.md)**:** A section to view and claim accumulated rewards.
