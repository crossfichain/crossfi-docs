# Escrow/Vesting

### Reward and Vesting System

Rewards generated from staking LP tokens can be claimed and used within the CrossFi ecosystem. The **escrow (vesting) system** allows users to gradually unlock esXFI tokens earned through staking. To convert esXFI into fully liquid XFI, users must initiate a vesting process, which requires them to maintain a set amount of LP tokens.

### **Escrow and Vesting Process:**

* Users initiate the vesting process, locking a portion of their LP tokens.
* Over time, esXFI gradually converts into claimable XFI.
* The longer the vesting period, the greater the overall reward accumulation.

### **How to Vest esXFI:**

1. Begin the vesting process in the escrow section.
2. Maintain the required LP token balance.
3. Claim vested XFI periodically as they become available.
