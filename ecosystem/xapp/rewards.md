# Rewards

The **Rewards** section in xAPP is your earnings dashboard: it shows what you’ve accumulated in each pool, and lets you **Claim** those tokens to your wallet.

## Pool‑by‑Pool Rewards

| Pool      | Claimable Token | How It’s Earned                                    |
| --------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **lpXFI** | **WETH**        | LayerZero bridge fees + swap fees (1%) → WETH      |
| **lpUSD** | **XFI**         | Foundation stake of MPX → esXFI → (auto‑vests) XFI |

> **Bonus Points (BP)** are an invisible, permanent loyalty metric:\
> • **+100 BP ≈ 1 LP XFI** staked for 1 year (100% APR on your LP)\
> • BP simply **increase your share** of every WETH & esXFI distribution.\
> • BP never need to be claimed—they’re accounted for under the hood.

## How to View & Claim

1. **Select your pool** at the top (lpXFI or lpUSD).
2. **See your “Claim” box** with the corresponding token (WETH or XFI).
3. **Click Claim** next to your balance.
4. **Approve** the transaction in your wallet.
5. **Funds arrive** instantly to your address.

> **Note:** When you claim XFI it arrives as **esXFI** on your Escrow balance—visit **Escrow → Claim XFI** to unlock (vest) it over time.

## Compounding Loop

To maximize yield, many users:

1. **Claim WETH** → **Swap** for XFI + xUSD → **Add Liquidity** → receive more LP.
2. **Claim XFI (esXFI)** → **Vest in Escrow** → unlock full XFI → **Re‑stake** as LP.

Looping through **swap → liquidity → stake → vest → restake** generates powerful compounding.

## Mini‑FAQ

**Q: Can I auto‑claim my rewards?**\
A: No—each Claim must be triggered manually so you control gas and timing.

**Q: How often can I claim?**\
A: At any time—there’s no minimum. Frequent claims keep your WETH and vesting XFI working for you.

**Q: Do I need to claim Bonus Points?**\
A: No—BP are an internal weight and never withdrawable.

**Q: What happens to XFI if I unstake LP?**\
A: Your unvested esXFI continues vesting (at a slower rate if you’ve fully unstaked). Fully vested XFI remain in your wallet.

**Q: Where can I see vesting progress?**\
A: In **Escrow → Vesting Status**, or via the tooltip in the Rewards section.
