# Staking

### Staking LP Tokens for Rewards

Liquidity providers can stake their LP tokens to earn additional rewards in the form of XFI, esXFI, and WETH/ETH. The staking system incentivizes long-term participation through bonus rewards, increasing users' potential earnings over time.

### **Staking and Reward Mechanisms:**

Users staking LP tokens receive rewards distributed across multiple streams:

1. **LayerZero Commissions** – A portion of LayerZero operational fees is allocated to ecosystem participants as ETH rewards.
2. **Trading Fees** – A share of transaction fees collected from CrossFi’s trading pools is distributed among active liquidity providers.
3. **Foundation Stake** – The CrossFi foundation stakes MPX to generate XFI rewards. Users can receive these in the form of esXFI, which requires vesting before converting into liquid XFI.

### **How to Stake LP Tokens:**

1. Navigate to the staking section in xAPP.
2. Select the LP token to stake (lpXFI, lpUSD, lpMPX).
3. Confirm the staking transaction via wallet integration.
