# Swap

xSwap is a decentralized exchange built for trading EVM tokens such as WXFI, USDT, BTC, and ETH. Utilizing an automated market-making (AMM) model, xSwap allows users to trade assets while also participating in liquidity pools to earn rewards. Each trade incurs a 1% transaction fee, which contributes to liquidity provider rewards. The integration with EVM-compatible wallets ensures a smooth and secure trading experience.

### **Swap Functionality**

xSwap enables users to exchange tokens within the CrossFi Chain, including USDT, XUSD, XFI, wXFI, eMPX, and other supported assets such as EXE. This feature allows for instant conversions without requiring external networks. Users can leverage xSwap for strategies such as trading XFI for USDT or acquiring more eMPX to enhance liquidity pool participation.

### **How to Use Swap:**

1. Select the amount of USDT, XFI, or another supported token to swap.
2. Review transaction details, including fees and exchange rates.
3. Approve and confirm the swap transaction.
