# XFI Console

{% embed url="https://xficonsole.com/" %}

**XFI Console** is the main entry point into the **CrossFi Chain** ecosystem, combining the capabilities of Cosmos and EVM into one seamless interface. The console allows you to manage your assets, participate in staking, vote in governance proposals, register readable domain-like names, and earn rewards for your activity — all from a single application.

It was designed to make working with CrossFi intuitive for both newcomers and experienced users. Instead of switching between wallets, interfaces, and networks, you get everything in one place. When you connect your wallet, XFI Console automatically links your EVM and Cosmos addresses and lets you perform operations on both layers without extra setup. This structure makes working with CrossFi logical, smooth, and convenient from the very beginning.

### Working Together with XFI Bridge

XFI Console works hand-in-hand with XFI Bridge, offering seamless token swaps and onboarding between external blockchains and the CrossFi network. The workflow is intuitive:

1. Connect your EVM wallet to XFI Console — it automatically generates and links your Cosmos address.
2. Head to XFI Bridge and connect the same EVM wallet.
3. Using **ZAP**, swap any token from supported external networks into XFI on the CrossFi EVM chain.
4. Return to XFI Console — the received XFI will already be visible in your wallet, ready for use in Cosmos or EVM actions.

You can also start the process from Bridge and finish in Console. The two tools are fully synchronized, ensuring a smooth user experience from the very first interaction.

## Features of XFI Console

### [Wallet — Asset Management Across Layers](https://xficonsole.com/cosmos-wallet)

XFI Console gives you a unified view of your holdings and transactions across the Cosmos and EVM layers of the CrossFi network. When you connect any EVM-compatible wallet (like MetaMask) via seed phrase, the Console automatically derives the corresponding Cosmos address and links them. Alternatively, Cosmos-native users can connect using Keplr, with EVM functionality linked automatically if needed.

Once connected, any deposit to either address will appear on both sides of the Console. You can send XFI and MPX, view full transaction history, and perform cross-token conversions directly within the interface. On the Cosmos side, users can convert **XFI into MPX**, choosing to pay transaction fees in either XFI or MPX, and also convert **MPX into eMPX** for use on the EVM layer. On the EVM side, users can send **XFI** and **EXE**, convert **eMPX back into MPX**, and manage custom tokens or NFTs through either a whitelist or manual import.

All transactions are tracked inside the Console, with quick access to external explorers like XFI Scan or EVM Scan.

### [Native Staking Protocol ](https://xficonsole.com/validators)

XFI Console provides a built-in interface for participating in staking through the **Native Staking Protocol**. Users who hold **MPX** tokens can delegate them to validators and earn staking rewards while contributing to network security.

The delegation process is straightforward. After opening the Staking tab, click **Bond** to see a list of active validators. Each validator’s commission rate and uptime are displayed to help you choose the right one. Once selected, you simply enter the amount of MPX to stake, choose the fee currency (XFI or MPX), and confirm the transaction.

For more advanced selection, you can use [XFI Scan](https://xfiscan.com/validators) to explore validator profiles and initiate delegation directly from the explorer, which will bring you back to the Console to complete the bonding process.

Full staking activity — including delegated amounts, validator status, and earned rewards — is visible in real time.

### [Governance — Participate in the DAO](https://xficonsole.com/proposals)

XFI Console integrates governance directly into the interface, giving token holders a voice in how the network evolves. Within the Governance tab, you can browse both active and completed proposals. Each proposal includes detailed information, such as its content, current voting distribution, quorum status, and on-chain history.

Voting is simple: select your response (Yes, No, Abstain, Veto) and confirm the action with your wallet. All proposals are executed on the Cosmos layer, and participation requires holding the appropriate governance tokens.

### XDS Name — Human-Readable Wallet Aliases

**XDS Name** is a user-friendly naming system that replaces long blockchain addresses with short and readable aliases like `yourname.xds`. These names can point to both Cosmos and EVM addresses, simplifying transactions and identity across the CrossFi ecosystem.

XDS is currently available in testnet and accessible via [test.xficonsole.com/xds](https://test.xficonsole.com/xds). In the future, these names will also be usable for dApp login, profile linking, and IPFS-based websites.

### [Rewards — Earn Through Participation](https://xficonsole.com/rewards)

XFI Console includes a **Rewards** section that showcases all current earning opportunities powered by the [XFI Foundation](https://xfi.foundation/). These programs reward users for activities like holding assets, supporting validators, or completing community engagement tasks.

Available programs are displayed clearly with information about eligibility, APR, and claim instructions — all integrated into the Console.

### [Resources ](https://xficonsole.com/resources)

The **Resources** tab acts as a curated dashboard of useful links and official channels:

* Listings on decentralized (DEX) and centralized (CEX) exchanges where you can buy XFI;
* Verified social media links;
* Documentation and reference tools;
* Community channels like Telegram, Discord, and Twitter.

This allows you to stay up-to-date and access verified information at all times.

### [Interface Settings](https://xficonsole.com/settings)

XFI Console includes simple interface customization options, including language selection. Additional preferences like fiat display currency, theme, and notification options are planned for future versions to improve the experience even further.
