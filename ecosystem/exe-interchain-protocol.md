{% embed url="https://exe.crossfi.org/" %}

### Overview

EXE Interchain Protocol is a decentralized platform built on the CrossFi blockchain, designed to accelerate the development and deployment of AI agents and decentralized AI services. By leveraging CrossFi’s modular architecture, which combines the scalability of Cosmos with the smart contract capabilities of EVM, EXE provides a seamless environment for AI application (dapp) interactions, access to decentralized GPU computational resources, and machine-to-machine transactions. With the AI agent market projected to grow to $47 billion by 2030, EXE positions itself as a leader in this transformation, offering a unified interchain platform for AI innovation.

### EXE Token

The native token of the EXE protocol, $EXE, serves multiple purposes. Users can pay for decentralized GPU computations and other AI services using $EXE tokens, while token holders can stake $EXE to earn rewards and support network security. Additionally, $EXE holders can participate in protocol governance by voting on proposals and updates that shape the future of EXE.

### For Developers

Integrating an AI application with EXE is straightforward and offers significant advantages. Developers can register their AI application via the EXE dashboard, providing metadata about its features, capabilities, and resource requirements. EXE smart contracts enable automated service discovery, matchmaking, and payments, simplifying connections to decentralized resources. Key benefits include:

* Access to an interchain marketplace of decentralized GPU computational resources, allowing applications to scale without complex integrations across different blockchains.
* Collaboration through EXE’s knowledge graph, which enables applications to discover and interact with other AI agents, fostering an ecosystem of interconnected services.

This approach helps developers reduce costs, simplify resource access, and focus on creating innovative AI solutions.

### For Users

Users can engage with EXE in several ways. They can browse and utilize a wide range of AI services registered on EXE, paying with $EXE tokens. Staking $EXE tokens offers the opportunity to earn rewards while supporting the security and operation of the network, and users can also vote on key protocol decisions using $EXE, influencing its future development.

### Adoption and Use Cases

EXE is gaining traction within blockchain and AI communities. At launch, it builds on the CrossFi ecosystem, which includes 50,000 active mainnet wallets and 700,000 testnet participants. Several Fortune 500 companies are exploring EXE for their AI deployment needs, signaling strong real-world potential. EXE also enables a new class of AI-driven decentralized finance applications, such as trading bots, predictive analytics for DeFi protocols, and autonomous agents for liquidity pool management.

### Plex Token Swap

To encourage early adoption, Plex holders can swap their tokens for $EXE at a special rate of 1 $PLEX = 10 $EXE, starting February 11, 2025. To participate, visit .

### Launch Details

The EXE protocol is scheduled to launch on February 11, 2025, with an anticipated initial market capitalization of $100 million. Tokens will be available for claiming starting on this date via , enabling users to immediately participate in the ecosystem.

### Technical Architecture

EXE leverages CrossFi’s unique two-layer architecture for high performance and interoperability:

* **Cosmos Layer:** Handles consensus, block production, and transaction verification, ensuring network security and efficiency.
* **EVM Layer:** Manages smart contract interactions and provides compatibility with EVM-based tools and applications, simplifying development and deployment.

This architecture supports resource-intensive AI services while maintaining scalability and cross-chain compatibility.

### Security

EXE incorporates advanced security features to protect users and ensure protocol integrity. Zero-knowledge proofs are used for machine-to-machine (M2M) transactions, ensuring data privacy and transaction integrity. Built on CrossFi’s decentralized blockchain, EXE inherits the security and transparency of distributed ledger technology.
