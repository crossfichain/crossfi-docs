# Cosmos and EVM Role

## Introduction

CrossFi Chain is a Layer 1 blockchain that harnesses the strengths of the Cosmos and Ethereum ecosystems to deliver a scalable, interoperable, and high-performance platform for decentralized applications (DApps). Built on the Cosmos SDK framework and powered by the Tendermint Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism, CrossFi Chain ensures rapid transaction finality, high throughput, and fault tolerance. Its full compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) enables developers to deploy Ethereum-compatible smart contracts and DApps using familiar Web3 tools and the Solidity programming language. This hybrid architecture makes CrossFi Chain a unique solution for decentralized finance (DeFi), bridging traditional finance with decentralized technologies while emphasizing network security, scalability, and extensive cross-chain interaction

### Architectural Layers

CrossFi Chain’s architecture is divided into three modular layers, each serving a distinct purpose:

* **Application Layer**: The top layer hosts smart contracts, DApps, and internal business logic. It includes Cosmos SDK modules for managing tokens, staking, governance, and other functions. This layer defines the network’s behavior, including smart contract execution and economic parameter management.
* **Execution Layer**: The middle layer handles transaction processing and blockchain state updates. It integrates the EVM for smart contract execution alongside Cosmos SDK modules for native operations (e.g., token transfers). Post-execution, it updates the network state and generates events.
* **Consensus Layer**: The foundational layer ensures transaction ordering and block creation with security guarantees. Powered by Tendermint BFT and a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) mechanism, validators collectively approve blocks to maintain a unified network state.

This separation enhances modularity, enabling independent development and optimization of each layer while preserving full interoperability.

### Integration of EVM and Cosmos SDK via ABCI Using Ethermint

The integration of Cosmos and EVM is a cornerstone of CrossFi Chain, achieved through the Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI). ABCI connects the Tendermint consensus engine to a Cosmos SDK-based application that incorporates Ethermint—a module adapting the EVM for Cosmos. This allows system components to interact efficiently, even across different programming languages.

#### Transaction Processing

When a transaction enters a CrossFi node (e.g., via a Web3 wallet), it follows these steps:

1. **Mempool Validation**: Tendermint performs a preliminary check (CheckTx), verifying signatures and fee sufficiency. Successful transactions await block inclusion.
2. **Block Formation**: A validator proposer assembles a new block, triggering the consensus process.
3. **Transaction Execution**: Tendermint invokes the application’s DeliverTx method via ABCI:
   * **EVM Transactions**: Smart contract calls are executed in an isolated EVM environment via Ethermint, updating account and contract states.
   * **Cosmos SDK Transactions**: Native operations (e.g., token transfers, staking) are processed by relevant Cosmos SDK modules.
4. **Results**: The application returns execution status (success/failure), updated state, and generated events via ABCI.

CrossFi combines EVM event logs (accessible via RPC) with Cosmos SDK events (indexed in blocks), ensuring compatibility with both ecosystems. This integration leverages Tendermint’s efficient consensus and Ethereum’s smart contract execution model, delivering high performance and scalability.

### Tendermint BFT Consensus Mechanism

CrossFi Chain employs Tendermint BFT to secure the network and maintain state consistency. This algorithm is resilient to Byzantine faults, functioning correctly even if up to one-third of validators act maliciously. Key features include:

* **Validators and DPoS**: Up to 128 validators are selected through stake delegation. XFI token holders delegate to trusted validators, influencing their voting power and engaging the community.
* **Block Production**: Tendermint operates in rounds. A proposer assembles a block, followed by two voting stages (Pre-vote and Pre-commit). A block is finalized with >2/3 validator approval, eliminating forks.
* **Performance**: Blocks are generated every \~5 seconds, supporting up to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS). The architecture allows further optimization, potentially reducing block time to 1 second.
* **Security**: Malicious actions (e.g., double signing) trigger slashing, burning a portion of the validator’s stake, economically deterring attacks and ensuring network integrity.

Tendermint provides rapid finality and high throughput, forming a robust foundation for CrossFi Chain.

### Interaction with DApps

CrossFi Chain offers a dual interface for DApp interaction, catering to developers from both ecosystems:

* **Web3/Ethereum Interface**: DApps connect via standard Ethereum tools (e.g., MetaMask, ethers.js) and CrossFi RPC nodes. Smart contract calls mirror Ethereum’s process but benefit from faster finality and lower fees.
* **Cosmos Interface**: Users engage in staking, governance, or IBC transfers using Cosmos-compatible wallets (e.g., Keplr) and Cosmos SDK transactions.
* **Transaction Formation and Submission**: Transactions are created, signed, and submitted similarly to Ethereum or Cosmos. DApps track execution via RPC or REST APIs.

This hybrid approach offers developers flexibility and ensures a seamless user experience.

### Cross-Chain Interaction

CrossFi Chain excels in interoperability through two mechanisms:

* **Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)**: Facilitates trustless token and data transfers with Cosmos zones (e.g., Cosmos Hub, Osmosis). Tokens are locked in CrossFi and minted as vouchers in the target network, ensuring security and decentralization.
* **Bridges with EVM Networks**: Connects to Ethereum and other EVM chains via standard bridge solutions (e.g., lock-and-mint). CrossFi’s EVM compatibility enables seamless asset transfers.

These capabilities allow DApps to interact with multiple blockchains, expanding functionality and user access.

### Security and Governance

CrossFi Chain prioritizes security and decentralized governance:

* **Staking and Economic Security**: Validators stake XFI, with slashing penalties (e.g., stake burning) for misbehavior like double signing. Rewards from fees and inflation incentivize honest participation.
* **Decentralized Governance**: Token holders propose and vote on network changes (e.g., parameters, upgrades), with voting power proportional to stake, ensuring community-driven evolution.
* **Technical Security**: Built on audited components (Tendermint, Cosmos SDK, Ethermint), with modular updates and planned features like account abstraction to enhance user security.

### Conclusion

CrossFi Chain is a powerful and flexible Layer 1 blockchain that merges Cosmos’s scalability and interoperability with Ethereum’s smart contract ecosystem. Its modular architecture, driven by Tendermint BFT and EVM compatibility via Ethermint, delivers high performance (up to 10,000 TPS), rapid finality, and robust security. With IBC and bridges, CrossFi connects diverse blockchains, fostering innovative DeFi applications. Developer-friendly and user-centric, CrossFi Chain bridges traditional finance and decentralized technologies, paving the way for future growth and adoption.
